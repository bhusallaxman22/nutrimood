## Development Commands

```bash
# Clear cache and restart if needed
cd nutrition-app
npx expo start --clear

# Check for any TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run on iOS simulator
npx expo start --ios

# Run on Android emulator  
npx expo start --android
```

## Debugging

If issues persist:

1. **Auth Persistence**: Check console logs for "Firebase Auth initialized" and "AsyncStorage is available"
2. **Social Posting**: Check console for "Creating post with text:" and any error messages
3. **Mood Tracking**: Verify alert shows with correct options
4. **Suggestions**: Check that button appears after mood tracking

All TypeScript errors have been resolved and the app should compile without issues.
