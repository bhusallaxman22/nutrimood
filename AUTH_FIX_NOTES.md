# Firebase Auth Persistence Fix for iOS

## Issues Fixed

1. **Proper Auth Context Management**: Created a robust AuthContext that handles auth state persistence across app restarts.

2. **Removed Manual Navigation**: Updated Login, SignUp, and Profile screens to not manually navigate after auth operations. This prevents conflicts with the auth state listener.

3. **AsyncStorage Integration**: Ensured AsyncStorage is properly imported and available for Firebase Auth persistence.

4. **Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and debugging logs for auth state changes.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. New AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Manages auth state with proper persistence
- Caches auth state in AsyncStorage as backup
- Handles auth state restoration on app startup
- Includes timeout protection to prevent infinite loading

### 2. Updated Firebase Configuration (`src/services/firebase.ts`)
- Proper AsyncStorage integration
- Development mode debugging
- Better error handling

### 3. Updated App.tsx
- Wrapped app with SafeAreaProvider and AuthProvider
- Ensures proper context availability throughout the app

### 4. Fixed Navigation Logic
- AppNavigator now uses AuthContext instead of local state
- Login/SignUp/Profile screens no longer manually navigate
- Auth state changes automatically trigger navigation

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear App Data**: Uninstall and reinstall the app to start fresh
2. **Login**: Log in with valid credentials
3. **Force Close**: Force close the app completely (not just background)
4. **Reopen**: Open the app again - you should remain logged in
5. **Background Test**: Background the app for extended periods and reopen

## iOS Specific Notes

- Firebase Auth in React Native uses AsyncStorage for persistence by default
- The new AuthContext provides additional caching layer for better reliability
- Auth state restoration should happen within 5 seconds (with timeout protection)

If persistence still doesn't work:
1. Check iOS device storage permissions
2. Ensure AsyncStorage has proper keychain access
3. Verify no iOS app cache clearing is happening
4. Check for any iOS-specific Firebase configuration needed

## Metro Cache Clear

Run these commands if you continue to have issues:

```bash
cd nutrition-app
npx expo start --clear
# or
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```
